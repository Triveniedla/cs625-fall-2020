## Part 1 - Using Tableu

In this homework, the public use Covid-19 data from the [Virginia Department of Health's COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/) is examined. The dataset contains the number of total tests and the number of positive PCR tests. In this part, the data is visualized using Tableau due to its excellent drag and drop options and other features that help in generating visualization within minutes.


#### 1.[VDH] How does the percentage of positive PCR tests over time compare for Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach?

The comparison of the percentage of positive PCR tests over time for Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach is plotted using the line plot. The attributed plotted on the x-axis is  __Lab Report Date__ and the ratio between __Number of Positive PCR Testing Encounters__, __Number of PCR Testing Encounters__  is plotted on the y-axis. The variation of the percentage of positive PCR tests for Norfolk, Chesapeake, Virginia Beach is represented by Orange, Blue, and Red color respectively.


![% of positive PCR](report_files/figure-gfm/Q1prcnt_of_positive_PCR_tests.png)


From the above line chart, it can be observed that there is a peak in the Virginia beach data in early March. Overall for all the health districts plotted, there are high fluctuations in the variation of the percentage of positive PCR tests. 



####  7-day moving average


![7 day moving average](report_files/figure-gfm/Q17-day_moving_average.png)
The above plot shows the 7-day moving average of positive PCR tests over time using line plots the same color markers used in the previous line plot is used. . __Lab Report Date__ is plotted on the x-axis and the 7-day average of percentage CR tests measured value is plotted. From the above plot, it is observed that the number of positive PCR tests reaches a peak around mid-July in all the cities. However, the Virginia beach has high number of cases compared to other cities.


#### 2. [VDH] For each health district, what percentage of the total tests given were PCR tests?

The comparisons of the percentage of PCR tests of total tests are plotted using a bar chart with __Health District__ attribute on the x-axis and the ratio between
__Number of PCR Testing Encounters__, __Total Number of Testing Encounters__ attributes is plotted on the y-axis. 

![% of total tests](report_files/figure-gfm/Q2%PCRtests_all_county.png)


The above bar chart shows the percentage of PCR tests of total COVID tests for each health district and all the districts have similar values.  

#### 3.[VDH, NYT] Was there a correlation between the percentage positive PCR tests averaged over July 16-28 (two weeks after the mask survey) and the estimated share of residents that answered "Frequently" or "Always" to the question of mask usage?

#### Show this for the following 15 health districts only: Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Portsmouth, Hampton, Western Tidewater, Peninsula, Fairfax, Arlington, Prince William, Richmond, Henrico, Chesterfield, Roanoke, Central Shenandoah.

#### For health districts that span multiple counties, pick the county with the highest population for the mask survey and name the county that you're considering.

The [Mask-Wearing Survey Data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use) dataset contains the answers given by the public for the mask questions in various counties represented by  [county-level FIPS codes](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/?cid=nrcs143_013697). The dataset does not have the county names and they are added to the dataset using the data from USDA website. For this purpose __Vlookup__ feature in Microsoft Excel is used.

The VDH COVID dataset contains the data of different health districts in Virginia whereas the __Mask-Wearing Survey__ dataset has counties. To plot the correlation between __percentage of positive PCR tests__ and the estimated share of residents that answered __Frequently__ or __Always__ to the mask survey, the __Health District__ attribute values needs to be similar. The data of counties with maximum population, for each __Health District__, in the VDH dataset is selected and the remaining data is deleted manually in Microsoft Excel. It is assumed that these counties represent the data of the __Health District__. The Counties considered for some of the __Health District__ are shown below.


__Norfolk__: __Norfolk city__

__Virginia Beach__: __Virginia Beach city__

__Chesapeake__: __Chesapeake__

__Portsmouth__: __Portsmouth__

__Fairfax__: __Fairfax City__

__Western tide water__: __Suffolk city__

__peninsula__: __Newport news__

__Richmond__: __Richmond city__

__Roanoke__: __Roanoke city__

__Central shenandoah__: __Rockingham__

__Hampton__: __Hampton city__





![% of positive PCR](report_files/figure-gfm/Q3correlation.png)

The correlation between __percentage of positive PCR tests__ and the estimated share of residents that answered __Frequently__ or __Always__ to the mask survey, is plotted using scatter plot. Circles are used as markers to represent each datapoint with blue color. The  __percentage of positive PCR tests__ is on the y-axis and the mask survey response is on the x-axis.It is observed  that there is a negative correlation between the two attributes


__Norfolk__: __Norfolk city__

__Virginia Beach__: __Virginia Beach city__

__Fairfax__: __Fairfax City__

__Western tide water__: __Suffolk city__

__peninsula__: __Newport news__

__Richmond__: __Richmond city__

__Roanoke__: __Roanoke city__

__Central shenandoah__: __Rockingham__

__Hampton__: __Hampton city__

## Part 2 - Using Programming Language/API:

In this part, R is used to replicate the visualizations plotted in Part-1. 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
VDH_covid_data <- read.csv(file = 'VDH-COVID-19-PublicUseDataset-Tests_by-LabReportDate.csv')

library(ggplot2)

linesize <- 1.25

p = ggplot() +
  
  geom_line(data = subset(VDH_covid_data, Health.District == "Norfolk"),aes(x = Lab.Report.Date, y = 100*Number.of.Positive.PCR.Testing.Encounters/Number.of.PCR.Testing.Encounters), color = "#F28E2B",size=linesize) +

In the below code the visualization for question 3 is replicated. The code automates such that the original mask data is used and required counties are filtered using the  IFPS codes.

```{r}

districts <- c("Arlington","Central Shenandoah","Chesapeake","Chesterfield","Fairfax","Hampton","Henrico","Norfolk","Peninsula","Portsmouth","Prince William","Richmond","Roanoke","Virginia Beach","Western Tidewater")

IFPS_codes <- c(51013,51165,51550,51041,51600,51650,51087,51710,51700,51740,51153,51159,51770,51810,51800)


prcntpcr <- c()
  
for (district in districts)
{
  dum <- subset(VDH_covid_data, Health.District == district)
  dum <- dum[dum$Lab.Report.Date >= "2020-07-16" & dum$Lab.Report.Date <= "2020-07-28",]

    
  # dumprcnt <- sum(dum$Number.of.Positive.PCR.Testing.Encounters,na.rm=T)/sum(dum$Number.of.PCR.Testing.Encounters,na.rm=T)
  
dumprcnt <- sum(dum$Number.of.Positive.PCR.Testing.Encounters/dum$Number.of.PCR.Testing.Encounters,na.rm=T)

  
    prcntpcr <- append(prcntpcr,dumprcnt)

}

mask_data <- read.csv(file = 'mask-use-by-county.csv')

prcntmask <- c()
  
for (code in IFPS_codes)
{
  dum <- subset(mask_data, COUNTYFP == code)
  dumprcnt <- dum$FREQUENTLY+dum$ALWAYS
  

  prcntmask <- append(prcntmask,dumprcnt)
}


plot(x = prcntmask,y = prcntpcr,
   xlab = "% of mask",
   ylab = "% of postive PCR",
   main = "postive pcr vs mask usuage"
)



```



The plots visualized using R are similar to the plots from Tableau. Tableau was a simple tool that can be used to generate visualizations efficiently. However, for the 3rd question, the manipulation is conducted manually in Excel whereas the process is automated. For large datasets, manual manipulation is difficult and R can automate the process.
